# 11. Deploy the web application to heroku

Date: 2021-02-36

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application must be deployed in some form and a good option is to use one of the major cloud platforms. Heroku is a well established platform providing a solution that is used by many smaller applications. 

## Decision

Deploy the webapplication to the Heroku Cloud Platform

## Consequences

Heroku is easy to use with a clear interface. It is integrated with GitHub which allows for continous deployment if that is wanted. It also allows to provision a postgreSQL database and connect to the webapplication so that is fully managed in the cloud. This combined with the ease of use makes it a good decision to use it for deployment of our application.
