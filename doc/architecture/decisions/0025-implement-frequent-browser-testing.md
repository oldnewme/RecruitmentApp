# 25. Implement frequent browser testing

Date: 2021-01-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context
Frequent browser testing ensures that all the functionality implemented can work on all browsers.
This also makes it easier to find bugs since implemented functionality can be tested straight away instead of the end.


## Decision

The project will use frequent browser testing

## Consequences
This sort of testing, like mentioned above will enable development since that if a problem is found in any of the browsers, it can be remedied straight away instead of in the end where the source of issue will be harder to find.
