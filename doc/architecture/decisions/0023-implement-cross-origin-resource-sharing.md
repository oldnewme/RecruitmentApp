# 23. Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

Date: 2021-02-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Since our website and server are hosted on two different cloud application platforms, their is a need for them to communicate with each other. This is done with Cross-Origin Resource 
Sharing (or CORS).

## Decision

The project will use CORS.

## Consequences

CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a webpage to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. This allows communication between all parts of the system.
