# 3. Implement Express.js as Web Application Framework

Date: 2021-02-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Express.js is a lightweight and customizable web application framework. It is the most commonly used web framework for the Node.js runtime environment. It provides basic routing, use of middleware, and static file serving among other things.

## Decision

We will use the Express.js as Web Application Framework.

## Consequences

It will be easier to implement a REST API for our backend with the functions provided by Express.js. As it is very popular, finding information on common issues will be easier should we run in to any.
