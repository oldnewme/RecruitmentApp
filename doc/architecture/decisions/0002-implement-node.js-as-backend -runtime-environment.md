Date: 2021-02-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To run a server that will serve incoming requests from a client a backend runtime environment must be chosen. Node.js is fast and scalable predominantly for applications that are not compute intensive. Since we are developing a CRUD applications it is a good fit. It has a strong developer community and popular frameworks that can be used with it.

## Decision

We will use Node.js as our backend runtime environment. We believe that it will be easy to maintain, scale and further develop the product using Node.js.

## Consequences

Node.js will let us use a vast number of frameworks and libraries that will simplify our development process.
